# tick

_tick_ is a Python 3 module for statistical learning, with a particular 
emphasis on time-dependent modelling. It is distributed under the 3-Clause 
BSD license, see [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt).

The project was started in 2016 by Emmanuel Bacry, Martin Bompaire, Stéphane 
Gaïffas and Søren Vinther Poulsen at the 
[Datascience initiative](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/datascience/en) 
of [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en), France.
The list of contributors is available in [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md).

## Quick description

_tick_ is a machine learning library for Python 3. The focus is on statistical
learning for time dependent systems, such as point processes. Tick features 
also tools for generalized linear models and a generic optimization toolbox.
The core of the library is an optimization module providing model
computational classes, solvers and proximal operators for regularization.

It comes also with inference and simulation tools intended for end-users who 
for example can easily:

- Perform linear, logistic or Poisson regression  
- Simulate point Hawkes processes with classic or exotic kernels. 
- Infer Hawkes models with various assumptions on the kernels (exponential or
 sum of exponential kernels, linear combination of basis kernels, sparse 
 interactions etc.)

A more comprehensive list of examples can be found at in this 
[gallery](https://x-datainitiative.github.io/tick/auto_examples/index.html).

The paper associated to this library has been published on 
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03003). If you use _tick_ in a scientific 
publication, we would appreciate citations.

## Use cases

_tick_ is used for many industrial applications including:

* [A joint work](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/datascience/fr/node/329) 
  with the French national health care (CNAMTS) to analyse the huge health 
  database anonymously describing the medical care provided to more than 65 
  million beneficiaries. For this project, _tick_ is used to detect weak
  signals in an unsupervised way such as unknown side effects for a given
  medicine.
   
* _tick_ tools have been used in finance to model high-frequency order book 
  data and analyse interactions between different event types and/or between 
  different assets, leveraging the full time resolution available in the 
  original data.

* Analyse social media information propagation. Thanks to a dataset collected 
  during 2017 French election campaign on Twitter, _tick_ is used to recover, 
  for each topic, the network across which the information spread into the 
  polical spectrum. 
  

## Installation

### Requirements

_tick_ currently only works on Linux/OSX systems and it also requires 
Python 3.4 or newer. Please have the required Python dependencies in your 
Python environment:

- numpy
- sciPy
- numpydoc
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- pandas

If you build and install _tick_ via _pip_ these dependencies will automatically 
be resolved.

If not, you can install all of these dependencies easily using:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

[Swig](http://www.swig.org/Doc3.0/SWIGDocumentation.html) might also be 
necessary if precompiled binaries are not available for your distribution.

### Source installations

For source installations, a C++ compiler capable of compiling C++11 source 
code (such as recent versions of [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or 
[clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)) must be available.
In addition, SWIG version 3.07 or newer must also be available.

### Install using _pip_

_tick_ is available via _pip_. In your local Python environment (or global, 
with sudo rights), do:

    pip install tick

Installation may take a few minutes to build and link C++ extensions. 
_tick_ should now be available.

### Manual Install

First you need to clone the repo and then init its submodules (such as cereal) 
with
 
    git submodule update --init

It's possible to manually build and install tick via the setup.py script. 
To do both in one step, do:

    python setup.py build install

This will build all required C++ extensions, and install the extensions in 
your current site-packages directory.

#### In-place (for developers)

If you wish to work with the source code of _tick_ it's convenient to have 
the extensions installed inside the source directory.
This way you will not have to install the module for each iteration of the code.

Simply do:

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

This will build all extensions, and install them directly in the source 
directory. To use the package outside the build directory, the build path 
should be added to the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable, as such (replace 
`$PWD` with the full path to the build directory if necessary):

    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PWD

## Help and Support

### Documentation

- Documentation is available on 
[https://x-datainitiative.github.io/tick](https://x-datainitiative.github.io/tick/).

- Documentation can be compiled and used locally by running `make html` 
from within the `doc` directory. This needs to have Sphinx installed.

- Several tutorials and code-samples are available in the documentation.
 
### Communication

To reach the developers of _tick_, please join our community channel on 
Gitter (https://gitter.im/xdata-tick).

If you've found a bug that needs attention, please raise an issue here on Github.
Please try to be as precise in the bug description as possible, such that the 
developers and other contributors can address the issue efficiently.

### Citation

If you use _tick_ in a scientific publication, we would appreciate citations.

## Developers

We welcome developers and researchers to contribute to the _tick_ package. 
In order to do so, we ask that you submit pull requests that will be reviewed 
by the _tick_ team before being merged into the package source.

### Pull Requests

We ask that pull requests meet the following standards:

- PR contains exactly 1 commit that has clear and meaningful description
- All unit tests pass (Python and C++)
- C++ code follows our style guide 
  ([Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html))
- If new functionality is added, new unit tests must be included in the pull 
  request

To ease this process, there is a script that automatically compiles and run 
all the necessary checks:

    ./build_test.sh

This command needs to be run from the package root directory.
To run all checks, 
[Python unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html), 
[gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest) and 
[cpplint](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cpplint) needs to be available. 
On most systems, this will suffice:

    # Install cpplint
    pip install cpplint

    # Install gtest
    git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
    (cd googletest && mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .. && make && make install)

Our continuous integration tool (Travis CI) will also run these checks upon 
submission of a pull request.
